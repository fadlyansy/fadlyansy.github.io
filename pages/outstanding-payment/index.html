            <b>Background</b><br>
            HappyFresh is an online grocery platform that used to operate in three countries but is now focused only on major cities in Indonesia, where people can do groceries at supermarkets through the HappyFresh app.<br>
            HappyFresh has shoppers who are on standby to purchase items according to orders. These shoppers typically use a company-provided credit card for purchases before the payment is settled by the finance team.
          </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="../../assets/images/portfolio/outstanding_payment/00_Background_Problem.png" alt="Outstanding Background" class="img-lm-1 mt-3 mb-3"><br>
            </div>
            <p class="p-portfolio p-4">
              Sometimes, some items are replaced with more expensive ones, or when the shopper starts shopping, additional items are added that can’t be adjusted immediately. HappyFresh customers might then have additional charges that result in outstanding fees or uncollected amounts. Currently, it takes weeks or even months for Customer Service to collect these amounts from customers. In some cases, these amounts are ultimately lost to HappyFresh.
            </p>

          </div>
          <p class="p-portfolio p-4">
            Over the past two weeks or so, there have been a lot of outstanding payments that haven’t been made and in general HappyFresh has 45-60% of uncollected CODs (outstanding fee) that caused $500-$1000 average loss in GMV each month. It could take weeks-months to collect outstanding fee from customers and Based on the user satisfaction report, customers were not happy with the flow to pay outstanding fees manually. It is a hustle.

            <b>Formed the way customer can paid outstanding</b><br>
            Based on the user satisfaction & finance report, we believe providing options to pay outstanding fees inside the app for customers will encourage them to pay outstanding fee as fast as possible.<br><br>

            <b>How the debt is communicated to users</b><br>
            Oftentimes, customers don’t open the HappyFresh app again after their order is completed. Sending push notifications can help remind them that they have an outstanding payment.
          </p>

            <b>Customer isn’t pay the debt</b><br>
            There's a possibility customers are too lazy to pay small amount of debt, or not turned off push notification, hence for customer who are not pay after 3 days, Customer Service will contacted them or <b>charged in the next order.</b>

          <p class="mt-2 p-portfolio p-4">
            <b>Customer has paid to driver</b><br>
            There are some dishonest drivers who ask customers to repay debts while they delivering order even though the customers have already paid in the app. That’s why proof of payment is needed to upload when customers pay through the app, and it helps the finance team flag the payment. However, in principle, any outstanding payment that has been paid should automatically be settled.

            <b>Lesson learned</b><br>
            In this project I work with the Finance, Operational and also Tech team, and a lot of things that I learned especially from Finance where there’s a lot of tasks they do and how we as Designer can communicate well to simplify big problems into small ones.<br>
            - Communication and collaboration with a broader team will make this success rate of this feature, especially with the operational team.<br>
            - A few technical constraints for tech team handle, learned to have middle ground so this featured can released well<br>
            So far, this is a really interesting project! 🙂
